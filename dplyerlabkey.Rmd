# DPLYER LAB KEY

#1) From the mpg data frame, use and show R code to produce a new data table
# that only shows data for the three variables manufacturer, model, and drv.

mpg

mpg%>%
  select(manufacturer, model, drv)

#2) From the mpg data frame, use and show R code to produce a new 
# data table that shows data for all vehicles whose city mileage cty is 
# less than 17. 
#Print the first 20 rows.

mpg%>%
  filter(cty < 17)


# 3) From the mpg data frame, use and show R code to produce a new data 
# table that only shows data for the manufacturer ford , class of 
# suv vehicles in the year 2008)  (You should only see 3 vehicles)


mpg%>%
  filter(manufacturer == "ford",  class == "suv", year == 2008)

# 4)  From the mpg data frame, use and show R code to produce a new data 
#table that shows highway mileage hwy only for dodge vehicles in descending 
# order.  Print the first 15 rows.

mpg%>%
  select(manufacturer, hwy)%>%
  filter(manufacturer == "dodge")%>%
  arrange(desc(hwy)) -> mpg1
mpg1

print(mpg1, n = 15)

# 5) Use the pipping method to create a new data table from the mpg data 
# frame that outputs the variables model, class, and cty. This new data 
# table also only shows city mileage for values less than 20 in descending 
# order for the model mustang.  Print the first 6 rows.

mpg%>%
  select(model, class, cty)%>%
filter(model =="mustang", cty < 20)%>%
arrange(desc(cty))-> mpg2
mpg2

print(mpg2, n = 6)

#6  
read_csv("astronautsdata.csv") -> AD
AD


#7
# Use dplyer functions to select the column variables Name, Gender, 
#   Military Branch ,Space Walks,  and Space Flights.

AD%>%
  select(Name, Gender, `Military Branch`, `Space Walks`,`Space Flights`) ->
  AD1
AD1

#8 Now modify the table that you obtained for #7 by using Rcode to produce
# a table that only shows female astronauts.

AD1%>%
  filter(Gender == "Female") -> AD2
AD2

#9
AD2%>%
  filter(`Military Branch` == "US Navy" , `Space Flights` >= 1)

#10 Show and use R code that will produce the mean number of Space Walks based
# on the gender of the astronauts.

AD%>%
  group_by(Gender)%>%
  summarise(MeanSpaceWalks = mean(`Space Walks`))
